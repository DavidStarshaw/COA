Explanatory Notes

1	This achievement standard is derived from Level 8 of The New Zealand Curriculum, Learning Media, Ministry of Education, 2007; and is related to the achievement objective:
•	Carry out investigations of phenomena, using the statistical enquiry cycle:
	using existing data sets
	finding, using, and assessing appropriate models (including additive models for time-series data), seeking explanations, and making predictions
	using informed contextual knowledge
	communicating findings and evaluating all stages of the cycle
in the Statistics strand of the Mathematics and Statistics Learning Area.  It is also related to the material in the Teaching and Learning Guide for Mathematics and Statistics, Ministry of Education, 2012, at http://seniorsecondary.tki.org.nz.

2	Investigate time series data involves showing evidence of using each component of the statistical enquiry cycle.

Investigate time series data, with justification involves linking components of the statistical enquiry cycle to the context, and referring to evidence such as statistics, data values, trends, or features of visual displays in support of statements made.

Investigate time series data, with statistical insight involves integrating statistical and contextual knowledge throughout the statistical enquiry cycle, and may include reflecting about the process; considering other relevant variables; evaluating the adequacy of any models; or showing a deeper understanding of models.

3	Using the statistical enquiry cycle to investigate time series data involves:
•	using existing data sets
•	selecting a variable to investigate
•	selecting and using appropriate display(s)
•	identifying features in the data and relating this to the context
•	finding an appropriate model
•	using the model to make a forecast
•	communicating findings in a conclusion.
