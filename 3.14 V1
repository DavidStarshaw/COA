Achievement	Achievement with Merit	Achievement with Excellence
•	Apply probability distributions in solving problems.	•	Apply probability distributions, using relational thinking, in solving problems.	•	Apply probability distributions, using extended abstract thinking, in solving problems.

Explanatory Notes

1	This achievement standard is derived from Level 8 of The New Zealand Curriculum, Learning Media, Ministry of Education, 2007; and is related to the achievement objectives:
•	Investigate situations that involve elements of chance
	calculating and interpreting expected values and standard deviations of discrete random variables
	applying distributions such as the Poisson, binomial, and normal
in the Statistics strand of the Mathematics and Statistics Learning Area.  It is also related to the material in the Teaching and Learning Guide for Mathematics and Statistics, Ministry of Education, 2012, at http://seniorsecondary.tki.org.nz.

2	Apply probability distributions in solving problems involves:
•	selecting and using methods
•	demonstrating knowledge of concepts and terms
•	communicating using appropriate representations.

Relational thinking involves one or more of:
•	selecting and carrying out a logical sequence of steps
•	connecting different concepts or representations
•	demonstrating understanding of concepts;
and also relating findings to a context or communicating thinking using appropriate statements.

Extended abstract thinking involves one or more of:
•	devising a strategy to investigate or solve a problem
•	identifying relevant concepts in context
•	developing a chain of logical reasoning
•	making a generalisation;
and also, where appropriate, using contextual knowledge to reflect on the answer.

3	Problems are situations that provide opportunities to apply knowledge or understanding of mathematical and statistical concepts and methods.  Situations will be set in real life or statistical contexts.

4	Methods are selected from those related to:
•	discrete and continuous probability distributions
•	mean and standard deviation of random variables
•	distribution of true probabilities versus distribution of model estimates of probabilities versus distribution of experimental estimates of probabilities.

5	Assessment Specifications for this achievement standard can be accessed through the Mathematics and Statistics Resources page found at http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/qualifications-standards/qualifications/ncea/subjects/.
