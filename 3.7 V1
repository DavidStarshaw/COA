Achievement Criteria

Achievement	Achievement with Merit	Achievement with Excellence
•	Apply integration methods in solving problems.	•	Apply integration methods, using relational thinking, in solving problems.	•	Apply integration methods, using extended abstract thinking, in solving problems.

Explanatory Notes

1	This achievement standard is derived from Level 8 of The New Zealand Curriculum, Learning Media, Ministry of Education, 2007; and is related to the achievement objectives:
•	Choose and apply a variety of integration and anti-differentiation techniques to functions and relations using both analytical and numerical methods
•	Form differential equations and interpret the solutions
in the Mathematics strand of the Mathematics and Statistics Learning Area.  It is also related to the material in the Teaching and Learning Guide for Mathematics and Statistics, Ministry of Education, 2012, at http://seniorsecondary.tki.org.nz.

2	Apply integration methods in solving problems involves:
•	selecting and using methods
•	demonstrating knowledge of concepts and terms
•	communicating using appropriate representations.

Relational thinking involves one or more of:
•	selecting and carrying out a logical sequence of steps
•	connecting different concepts or representations
•	demonstrating understanding of concepts
•	forming and using a model;
and also relating findings to a context, or communicating thinking using appropriate mathematical statements.

Extended abstract thinking involves one or more of:
•	devising a strategy to investigate or solve a problem
•	identifying relevant concepts in context
•	developing a chain of logical reasoning, or proof
•	forming a generalisation;
and also using correct mathematical statements, or communicating mathematical insight.

3	Problems are situations that provide opportunities to apply knowledge or understanding of mathematical concepts and methods.  Situations will be set in real-life or mathematical contexts.

4	Methods are selected from those related to:
•	integrating power, polynomial, exponential (base e only), trigonometric, and rational functions
•	reverse chain rule, trigonometric formulae
•	rates of change problems
•	areas under or between graphs of functions, by integration
•	finding areas using numerical methods, eg the rectangle or trapezium rule
•	differential equations of the forms y' = f(x) or y" = f(x) for the above functions or situations where the variables are separable (eg y' = ky) in applications such as growth and decay, inflation, Newton's Law of Cooling and similar situations.
