Explanatory Notes

1	This achievement standard is derived from Level 8 of The New Zealand Curriculum, Learning Media, Ministry of Education, 2007; and is related to the achievement objective:
•	Investigate situations that involve elements of chance
-	calculating probabilities of independent, combined, and conditional events
in the Statistics strand of the Mathematics and Statistics Learning Area.  It is also related to the material in the Teaching and Learning Guide for Mathematics and Statistics, Ministry of Education, 2012, at http://seniorsecondary.tki.org.nz.

2	Apply probability concepts in solving problems involves:
•	selecting and using methods
•	demonstrating knowledge of concepts and terms
•	communicating using appropriate representations.

Relational thinking involves one or more of:
•	selecting and carrying out a logical sequence of steps
•	connecting different concepts or representations
•	demonstrating understanding of concepts;
and also relating findings to a context or communicating thinking using appropriate statements.

Extended abstract thinking involves one or more of:
•	devising a strategy to investigate or solve a problem
•	identifying relevant concepts in context
•	developing a chain of logical reasoning
•	making a generalisation;
and also where appropriate, using contextual knowledge to reflect on the answer.

3	Problems are situations that provide opportunities to apply knowledge or understanding of mathematical and statistical concepts and methods.  Situations will be set in real-life or statistical contexts.

4	Methods are selected from those related to:
•	true probability versus model estimates versus experimental estimates
•	randomness
•	independence
•	mutually exclusive events
•	conditional probabilities
•	probability distribution tables and graphs
•	two way tables
•	probability trees
•	Venn diagrams.
