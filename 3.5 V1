Explanatory Notes

1	This achievement standard is derived from Level 8 of The New Zealand Curriculum, Learning Media, Ministry of Education, 2007; and is related to the achievement objectives:
•	Manipulate complex numbers and present them graphically
•	Form and use polynomial, and other non-linear equations
in the Mathematics strand of the Mathematics and Statistics Learning Area.  It is also related to the material in the Teaching and Learning Guide for Mathematics and Statistics, Ministry of Education, 2012, at http://seniorsecondary.tki.org.nz/.

2	Apply the algebra of complex numbers in solving problems involves:
•	selecting and using methods
•	demonstrating knowledge of concepts and terms
•	communicating using appropriate representations.

Relational thinking involves one or more of:
•	selecting and carrying out a logical sequence of steps
•	connecting different concepts or representations
•	demonstrating understanding of concepts
•	forming and using a model;
and also relating findings to a context, or communicating thinking using appropriate mathematical statements.

Extended abstract thinking involves one or more of:
•	devising a strategy to investigate or solve a problem
•	identifying relevant concepts in context
•	developing a chain of logical reasoning, or proof
•	forming a generalisation;
and also using correct mathematical statements, or communicating mathematical insight.

3	Problems are situations that provide opportunities to apply knowledge or understanding of mathematical concepts and methods.  Situations will be set in real-life or mathematical contexts.

4	Methods are selected from those related to:
•	quadratic and cubic equations with complex roots
•	Argand diagrams
•	polar and rectangular forms
•	manipulation of surds
•	manipulation of complex numbers
•	loci
•	De Moivre’s theorem
•	equations of the form zn = r cis , or zn = a + b i where a, b are real and n is a positive integer.
