Explanatory Notes

1	This achievement standard is derived from Level 8 of The New Zealand Curriculum, Learning Media, Ministry of Education, 2007; and is related to the achievement objective:
•	Evaluate a wide range of statistically based reports, including surveys and polls, experiments, and observational studies:
	critiquing causal-relationship claims
	interpreting margins of error
in the Statistics strand of the Mathematics and Statistics Learning Area.  It is also related to the material in the Teaching and Learning Guide for Mathematics and Statistics, Ministry of Education, 2012, at http://seniorsecondary.tki.org.nz.

2	Evaluate statistically based reports involves identifying and commenting on key features in reports relevant to conclusions made in those reports.

Evaluate statistically based reports, with justification involves supporting the comments made by referring to statistical evidence and processes described in reports, relevant to conclusions made in those reports.

Evaluate statistically based reports, with statistical insight involves integrating statistical and contextual information to assess the quality of reports with respect to conclusions made in those reports.

3	Evaluating statistical reports requires familiarity with:
•	the statistical enquiry cycle
•	principles of experimental design
•	surveys and polls, including potential sources of bias
•	interpreting statistical inferences
•	interpreting a wide variety of statistical tables and graphs
•	analysing a wide variety of statistical situations
•	critiquing causal-relationship claims
•	interpreting margins of error.
