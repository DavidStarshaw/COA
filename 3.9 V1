Explanatory Notes

1	This achievement standard is derived from Level 8 of The New Zealand Curriculum, Learning Media, Ministry of Education, 2007; and is related to the achievement objective:
•	Carry out investigations of phenomena, using the statistical enquiry cycle:
	using existing data sets
	finding, using, and assessing appropriate models (including linear regression for bivariate data), seeking explanations, and making predictions
	using informed contextual knowledge and statistical inference
	communicating findings and evaluating all stages of the cycle
in the Statistics strand of the Mathematics and Statistics Learning Area.  It is also related to the material in the Teaching and Learning Guide for Mathematics and Statistics, Ministry of Education, 2012, at http://seniorsecondary.tki.org.nz.

2	Investigate bivariate measurement data involves showing evidence of using each component of the statistical enquiry cycle.

Investigate bivariate measurement data, with justification involves linking components of the statistical enquiry cycle to the context, and referring to evidence such as statistics, data values, trends, or features of visual displays in support of statements made.

Investigate bivariate measurement data, with statistical insight involves integrating statistical and contextual knowledge throughout the investigation process, and may include reflecting about the process; considering other relevant variables; evaluating the adequacy of any models, or showing a deeper understanding of the models.

3	Using the statistical enquiry cycle to investigate bivariate measurement data involves:
•	posing an appropriate relationship question using a given multivariate data set
•	selecting and using appropriate displays
•	identifying features in data
•	finding an appropriate model
•	describing the nature and strength of the relationship and relating this to the context
•	using the model to make a prediction
•	communicating findings in a conclusion.

4	Measurement data can either be discrete or continuous in nature.  In regression analysis the y-variable, or response variable, must be a continuous variable.  The x variable or explanatory variable can be either a discrete or continuous variable.
The relationship may be non-linear.

5	Use and interpretation of R2 is not expected at this level.
